    q: "What is an AI prompt library?",
    a: "An AI prompt library is a curated collection of pre-written instructions designed to get the best results from AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and image generators like Midjourney. Instead of writing prompts from scratch, you copy a template, fill in the bracketed placeholders with your specifics, and get consistently high-quality outputs. Good prompts take time to craft — a library saves that time.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I use these prompts with any AI tool?",
    a: "Most text prompts in this library are tagged 'Any' and work across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other large language models. Image generation prompts are specifically formatted for Midjourney, DALL-E, or Stable Diffusion as noted. The core technique (being specific, providing context, defining output format) works universally, though some syntax like '--ar 16:9' is Midjourney-specific.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I get the best results from these prompts?",
    a: "Replace every [bracketed placeholder] with your specific details. The more context you provide, the better the output. For complex tasks, break them into steps — use one prompt to generate an outline, then another to expand each section. If the first result isn't perfect, add 'Revise the above to be more [specific quality you want]' rather than starting over. Claude and GPT-4 both respond well to role-setting: 'Act as a senior [role]...'",
  },
  {
    q: "Are these prompts free to use commercially?",
    a: "Yes. Every prompt in this library is free to use for personal and commercial projects. The outputs you generate belong to you (subject to the terms of the AI tool you use). We only ask that you don't republish this collection wholesale as your own prompt library.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between a good prompt and a bad one?",
    a: "Bad prompts are vague: 'Write a blog post about marketing.' Good prompts specify role, context, format, length, tone, audience, and constraints: 'Act as a B2B content strategist. Write a 1,200-word blog post targeting SaaS founders about email marketing ROI. Use H2 subheadings, include 3 actionable tips with real examples, and end with a CTA to download a free template. Tone: authoritative but approachable.' The difference in output quality is dramatic.",
